 * First find d to be the minimum of n1 and n2, then check whether d, d-1, d-2, ..., 2, or 1 is a divisor for both n1
 * and n2 in this order. The first such common divisor is the greatest common divisor for n1 and n2. Write a program
 * that prompts the user to enter two positive integers and displays the gcd.
