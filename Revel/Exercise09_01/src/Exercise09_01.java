/**
 * (The Rectangle class) Follow the example of the Circle class in section 9.2, design a
 * class named Rectangle to represent a rectangle. The class contains:
 * ~ Two double data fields named width and height that specify the width and height
 * of the rectangle. The default values are 1 for both width and height.
 * ~ A no-arg constructor that creates a default rectangle.
 * ~ A constructor that creates a rectangle with the specified height and width.
 * ~ A method name getArea() the returns the area of this rectangle.
 * ~ A method named getPerimeter() that returns the perimeter.
 * ~ Draw the UML diagram for the class and then implement the class. Write a test program
 * that creates two Rectangle objects-one with a width of 4 and height 40 and the other
 * with width 3.5 and height 35.9. Display the width, height, area, and perimeter of
 * each rectangle in this order.
